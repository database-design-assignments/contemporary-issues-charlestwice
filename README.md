# Should Apple create a backdoor to let the DOJ or other federal authorities to access suspects' iPhones for evidences?
In this document, I discuss two articles about different viewpoints of whether big tech companies should listen to federal authorities to further help with terrorism cases or other more serious crimes. Below are the two viewpoints from both sides of the topic.

## Article 1
In Apple's [Answers to your questions about Apple and security?](https://www.apple.com/customer-letter/answers/)
Apple argued that by creating a backdoor for the government agencies might actually create a more dangerous scenario since the backdoor might be stolen by bad guys, which will put consumers' privacy, data, and safety very dangerously. Also, if a new software is developed by Apple, it would become easier for hackers to hack into one's phone by "brute force", which would not only create risks but would also make consumers not to buy Apple's product because of safety reasons. Furthermore, digital footprint is very hard to erase; therefore, once the unlocking software is created, it can be use anytime, anywhere.

In addition, the other argument that Apple claimed was that it would set a precedent for the government to have more access to personal data, which might led to a more unconstitutional acts since the government probably might access anyone's data very easily. In addition, privacy is protected by the 4th amendment of the US constitution, which unreasonable seizures and searches shall not be violated.

## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in Apple on the issue, DOJ's [The U.S. government is pressuring Apple to unlock an iPhone. Again.](https://mashable.com/article/apple-shooting-unlock-iphone-encryption-backdoor/) 
The refusal for Apple to help the federal departments could be hard to justify since after 911, USA has been waging war against terrorist, and it is very reasonable for US companies to help federal agencies to combat terrorists and find more evidences to convict them. Government wanted to gain more access for only the suspects, but not other innocent citizens, so it is fairly reasonable to make Apple to provide a way to unlock the iPhone.
On the other hand from the other viewpoint of a business, one could say that Apple's unwillingness to assist the government is because of the business model and marketing strategy since people nowadays are very sensitive regarding the issue of data privacy. And, of course, one of the most important things about companies is its corporate image. Once a corporate image is damaged, it would take years or even never to restore it. Therefore, Apple might really be trying to protecting itself rather than protecting "we the users"
